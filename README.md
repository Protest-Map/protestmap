# Protest Map
Protest Map is a community-driven volunteer-led crowdmapping platform to map any and every act of rebellion and resilience against this global capitalist order and the nexus of heteropatriarchy, neo-liberalism, imperialism, colonialism, white-supremacy and racism that it stands on.

Be it protests, strikes, marches, demonstrations, sit-ins, industrial actions, office addresses of relevant organizations, meeting spots, study circle bulletins, reading group invites, location pins of progressive community spaces, mutual aid calls, solidarity initiatives, stories of everyday resistance, pointers to worker cooperatives and communal housing, any such thing that has a geospatial (geographic and location-based) component, goes here!

The theory is to internationalize the struggle by sharing stories, learning from fellow comrades and organizers, linking the movements, building global solidarity, and coordinating our actions to smash the system once and for all.

Our enemies on the top use maps and cartography to divide us with artificial borders, carve empires, plan wars, drop bombs, exploit natural resources, and cause ecological destruction. So why don't we reclaim the tools and use them to re-map our lives and stories from our perspective? Let's countermap!
